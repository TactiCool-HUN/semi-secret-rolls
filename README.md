# Origins
This module has been inspired by reddit user u/Ahaskins [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/1230ox7/house_rule_alternative_to_secret_rolls_the/) about rolling 4 public dice to roll secret rolls, from which only the GM knows which one is the true one.

# You can support me on Ko-Fi!
Not at all required, but I'm always happy to have a bit more spending money, uni life is though >.<

# What does it do?
Whenever a blind or secret roll is made it rolls 4 times and shows all 4 to the players, only one of it is the actual outcome (they don't know which). Meanwhile, the original is still shown to the GM(s).

## Settings

If you have suggestions for settings or features please let me know by opening an issue with the suggestion tag!

### Disable Module

GM side setting.

If this setting is turned on the module acts as if it was completely disabled, this setting doesn't require a reload to work.

### Ignore GMs

GM side setting.

By default, this is turned on, as GMs don't really need this feature, but you can turn it off if you want it for roleplay or similar purposes (warning! it will show the die formula to the players)

### Semi-Secret Dice Amount

GM side setting.

Can adjust how many dice are rolled (defaults to 4, includes the original).
If set to 0 (and after a reload) everyone can set their own custom dice amount as a client side setting.

### Semi-Secret Visibility

GM side setting.

Adjust who sees the semi-secret rolls:
- Everyone
- Everyone except the GM
- The player who rolled + the GM
- Only the player who rolled

### Divider Dots

Client side setting.

Toggles whether your own semi-secret rolls have divider dots in-between them, I found that it improves readability at the cost of more space.
